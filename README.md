# System Request Profiler - CLI Tool

This CLI tool will make requests against a specified URL and will print
out the response body. If specified with a flag, it will create a profile
for multiple requests including the request-response cycle time, response sizes,
and any errors returned.  

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the System Profiler up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

[Go Compiler](https://golang.org/doc/install)

This project is written in the Go language.  It can be compiled to be run without
a Go installation, but this tool is best used with the Go installed locally as it
will allow for changing the URL you are testing as well as the number of requests
to be made for profile statistics.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
`git clone
